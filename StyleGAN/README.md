# StyleGAN

This notebook shows an implementation of [StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf) using Pytorch and fast.ai. Details of the model architecture, implementation and training process can be found in the [notebook](https://github.com/kheyer/ML-DL-Projects/blob/master/StyleGAN/StyleGAN.ipynb) along with some history of GAN development leading up to StyleGAN.

I am but one man with one GPU, so these are the best 128x128 faces I can produce in a reasonable amount of compute time. However if you happen to have a DGX station lying around the code in the notebook will scale up to 1024x1024 images.
